                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Introverted :</strong> While this makes making friends difficult, it drives a focus on deep, independent work and complex problem-solving, which is a key asset in computer science and programming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creative Outlet (Traditional & Digital Art):</strong> I am an artist proficient in both traditional drawings and digital art. I use art as a coping mechanism and source of motivation when facing academic stress or burnout, helping me maintain mental well-being and return to my studies refreshed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creative Writing:</strong> I enjoy writing stories. This hobby strengthens my communication and narrative skills, which are directly helpful for courses like English and in technical documentation.</li>

                <h3>My Hero: Robert Downey Jr.</h3>
                <p><strong>Background:</strong> Robert Downey Jr.'s public struggle and subsequent recovery from severe drug addiction demonstrate the profound power of self-reform. His journey illustrates that anyone, regardless of past mistakes, can achieve tremendous success through hard work and dedication.</p>
                <p><strong>Motto/Quote:</strong> "I think that the power is the principle. The principle of moving forward, as though you have the confidence to move forward, eventually gives you confidence when you look back and see what you've done.”</p>
                <p><strong>Why they are my hero:</strong> He is a symbol of resilience and the idea that sustained effort toward a positive goal eventually builds true self-belief and a powerful legacy.</p>
                
                <h3>AI Business Idea Review: Personalized Fitness and Nutrition Plans</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Concept and Functionality:</strong> This idea centers on creating an AI-powered application that tailors health and wellness practices for individual users. The system creates highly customized plans by analyzing demographics (age, weight), activity level, health objectives (weight loss, muscle gain), and dietary preferences (restrictions, allergies).</p>
                <p><strong>Key AI Capabilities:</strong> The AI dynamically adapts to user progress, recommending custom meal plans, specific workout routines, and personalized lifestyle adjustments. Crucially, it automatically evolves the plan—for example, shifting from a weight loss program to a maintenance plan once a goal is achieved.</p>
                <p><strong>Ethical Reflection:</strong> A primary moral concern is data privacy and the potential for algorithmic bias in health recommendations based on incomplete or skewed data. My solution would be strict, transparent data encryption and user-controlled data sharing, ensuring the user has the final say and can override any AI suggestion.</p>

            <h2>3. Personal Development: Twelve Pillars Reflection</h2>
            
            <article>
                <h3>Chapter 4: The Pillar of Learning</h3>
                <p>Summary & Alignment: Success requires continuous learning, specifically the conversion of raw knowledge into **wisdom (applied knowledge)**. Alignment involves being intentional about what you learn and dedicating non-negotiable, focused time for high-quality input and immediate reflection on how to apply it.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Chapter 5: The Pillar of Mentorship</h3>
                <p>Summary & Alignment: Growth is accelerated by seeking mentors who have already achieved your goals. The key is to be humble, proactively identify specific needs, and approach potential mentors by seeking to **offer value first** to show respect for their time and experience.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Chapter 6: The Pillar of Health</h3>
                <p>Summary & Alignment: Health is the essential foundation for all other pillars, as a great life demands energy. Alignment is achieved through simple, non-negotiable daily disciplines covering **physical movement** and mindful control of mental inputs, and prioritizing consistency over intensity in all health habits.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Chapter 7: The Pillar of Family</h3>
                <p>Summary & Alignment: True success is ultimately measured by the quality of relationships with loved ones. This pillar demands radical prioritization: establishing non-negotiable time free from distractions (putting the phone away), committing to daily active appreciation, and actively sharing values with the next generation.</p>
